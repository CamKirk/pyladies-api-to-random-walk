# Houston Pyladies: From API to Trading Bot

Based on random walk code found [here](https://pythonforfinance.net/2016/11/28/monte-carlo-simulation-in-python/)

To run this code:

- You need to sign up for the Quandl API at [quandl.com](https://quandl.com)
- Create a config.py in your root directory
- In config.py, create a python variable called quandl_key, and set it to the string containing your key from the quandl API.

Note:
	It is likely that you won't be able to preview the notebook on github, so it will require you to clone and open the jupyter notebook to view the contents.
